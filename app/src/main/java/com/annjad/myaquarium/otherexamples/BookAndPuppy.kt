 * It can be useful to know the weight of a book, for example, for shipping. The weight of
 * a book can change because sometimes pages get torn, and the page count changes. While
 * calculating the weight could be defined as a method, itâ€™s more like a helper function.
 *
 * Add a mutable property pages to Book.
 * Create an extension function on Book that returns the weight of a book as the page count
 * multiplied by 1.5 grams.
 * Create another extension, tornPages(), that takes the number of torn pages as an argument
 * and changes the page count of the book.
 * Write a class Puppy with a method playWithBook() that takes a book as an argument,
 * and removes a random number of pages from the book.
 * Create a puppy and give it a book to play with, until there are no more pages.*/
